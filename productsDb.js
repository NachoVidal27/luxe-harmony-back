      "The new Billie Joe Armstrong Les Paul™ Junior is an exceptional guitar to rock out on, whether you play rock or punk. Designed in collaboration with Green Day’s legendary guitarist, it has everything you need for great tone with no frills to get in your way, including a mahogany neck with a Billie Joe Armstrong SlimTaper™ profile, rosewood fretboard, Graph Tech® nut, and Billie Joe’s signature on the truss rod cover. The mahogany body is equipped with a wraparound bridge/tailpiece and a P-90 DC Dogear pickup. The P-90 DC is our latest hum-canceling design. It features a modernized version of the Sidewinder dual-coil technology that was first developed by Seth Lover in 1958, delivering a hum-free P-90 with the most authentic P-90 tonality yet, retaining the classic sound of a single",
